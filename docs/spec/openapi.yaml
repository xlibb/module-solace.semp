        To use client authorization groups configured on an external server to provide
        client authorizations, Authorization Group objects must be created on the
        Message VPN that match the authorization groups provisioned on the external
        server. These objects must be configured with the client profiles and ACL
        profiles that will be assigned to the clients that belong to those authorization
        groups. A newly created group is placed at the end of the group list which
        is the lowest priority.

        to REST consumers. If the queue does not exist it can be created subsequently,
        and once the queue is operational the broker performs the queue binding. Removing
        the queue binding does not delete the queue itself. Similarly, removing the
        queue does not remove the queue binding, which fails until the queue is recreated
        or the queue binding is deleted.
